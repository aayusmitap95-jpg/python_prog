# Given the variable x and the variable y which have been set for you, write the following

# Print the value of x multiplied by y
# Print the value of the output of step 1 divided by 1.5
# Print the value of the output of step 2 plus by 20
# Print the value of the output of step 3 minus 10
x = 14
y = 7
print(x * y)
print((x * y)/1.5)
print(((x * y)/1.5)+20)
print((((x * y)/1.5)+20)-10)

# Given the variable x, use the assignment shortcuts to modify its value with the following operations:

# Multiply x by 3
# Divide x by 2
# Add 10 to x
x = 6
x *= 3
x /= 2
x += 10
print(x)

#Using parentheses change the order of operations in the following expressions to get the desired result.
print((2 + 2) * 2, "= 8")
print((2 + (2 ** 2)), "= 6")
print((1 + 1) * (1 + 1), "= 4")
